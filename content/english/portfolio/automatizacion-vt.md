description: "Digital transformation in Veritran, starting with the
implementation of DevOps."
problem: "The core of their system was programmed in C/C++ and had to run on
various platforms, which required compiling each new version on several
different architectures. This task required advanced knowledge and created a
bottleneck. In turn, the company needed to implement its platform with Docker."
solution: "We managed to completely automate the generation of executables for
all platforms, so today the task can be performed by a person without knowledge
of C/C++. This substantially streamlined the process and freed up time of their
more experienced talents. In addition, we generated a platform's demo with
Docker, which required adapting its architecture."

Forming an excellent team with Veritran, we jointly defined a semantic version
for the platform and its components, establishing the dependencies that would
simplify the compatibility management. In the same way, we standardized coding
styles, we managed to migrate the versioning system from SVN to GIT, and we
defined a workflow adapted to Veritran's needs. In turn, we implemented
different pipelines with Gitlab CI and Jenkins to automate the task of
generating executables for different architectures, including AIX, Solaris, and
various versions of Red Hat and CentOS. The generated executables are
automatically stored in a centralized repository, implemented with Nexus, with
all the versioning conventions defined. We also worked to assemble the existing
platform with Docker, as well as the new components that have been developed
and, later, we accompanied the process of adopting Kubernetes and adapting the
platform as SaaS on AWS.
