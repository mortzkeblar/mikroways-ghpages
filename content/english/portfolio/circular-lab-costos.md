problem: "Circular-Lab had a number of productive applications on AWS
infrastructure. They didn't present functional problems, but their monthly cost
was excessive."
solution: "After a detailed analysis of the infrastructure, we implemented a
series of improvements, reducing costs by more than 50% in the first month
alone. During the implementation, we didn't compromise any of the requirements
with which the infrastructure had been originally designed."

After understanding the client's needs, the following goals were set:

* Reduce Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure costs.
* Increase the availability and security of services, ensuring compliance with
  the GDPR.
* Simplify application deployment.

We started by reviewing all AWS services architecture and cost drivers. This led
us to redesign it, simplifying it and eliminating unnecessary components without
sacrificing the expected levels of availability or security.

In the following iterations we focused on the fulfillment of the other
objectives. Among other tasks, we provided elasticity to the infrastructure so
that it could automatically adjust to demand; we expanded the coverage of
compliance with the GDPR; we accelerated and simplified the deployment of new
applications by incorporating continuous integration and deployment processes;
and we optimized the backup mechanism to guarantee backups, efficiently using
the resources.
