# Problem overview
problem: "The client is in the process of adopting a DevSecOps strategy. They
aim to embrace Cloud Native solutions to improve their services as well as
create synergy with their providers.  Despite these positive efforts, they also
face challenges related to the observability of their IT services.  They lack a
clear and comprehensive view of their service infrastructure's health status.
This hinders the early identification of operational problems. Additionally, it
complicates the detection of the origin of the issues once they arise.  This
aspect impacts the stability and quality of service, as well as the confidence
of the different stakeholders. It underscores the importance of addressing
observability concerns  to ensure a successful and smooth implementation."
# Solution overview
solution: "To tackle the identified challenges in the bankâ€™s infrastructure, a
comprehensive solution was implemented. 
The adoption of cutting-edge practices, such as infrastructure-as-code on AWS
with Kubernetes, ensures adherence to the BCRA's stringent standards, and
establishes a solid foundation for the agile development of cloud-native
services. The introduction of continuous deployment and integration (CI/CD)
workflows streamlines the development lifecycle. Furthermore, a comprehensive
observability solution was implemented, featuring customized dashboards and
employing advanced tools for tracing, logs, and metrics. 
This  comprehensive approach not only provided effective and thorough control
over IT services but also anticipated issues. It improved operational
efficiency, leading to enhanced service for users while reducing operational
costs."
