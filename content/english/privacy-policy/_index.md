### Introduction

One of the main objectives of Mikroways is to guarantee the satisfaction of our clients,
always promoting the continuous improvement of the quality of our services.
In addition to this, the main focus of the tasks we develop is to provide DevSecOps services.
As a fundamental axis within our commitment to clients, we position confidentiality,
privacy and clarity about the way in which we work with your information.

We are convinced that part of this satisfaction that we seek is related to transparency,
and the clarity of the processes used with our clients. For this reason, this confidentiality and
privacy policy expresses the detail about what information Mikroways has about its clients,
related to the authentication that is carried out to give access to the services we offer,
for what purpose, and how we protect that.

### Exclusive information for the services authentication

Mikroways provides information related to the services it provides to its clients, protecting
it through unique access credentials. For this it is necessary that each client has unique and
own credentials (username / password). In order for these credentials to be generated, it is
necessary for the client to finish with a registration process on a Mikroways platform provided
for this purpose, in which each client must enter the following data:

- Firstname
- Lastname
- Email

Based on these data, an account will be generated that will allow the customer to access
information specific to the services that Mikroways provides. This data is the ONLY one
that Mikroways could require from the user to carry out the authentication process.

### Integration with identity providers

In order to facilitate the authentication process, Mikroways offers its customers the
possibility of integrating this process using well-known identity providers such as
Google (in the future it is planned to use others such as GitLab or others).

For this process, it is necessary that the client choose one of these identity providers and
indicates with which account they will link with out platform. For example, in the Google case,
you must indicate an email account with which the user will be identified.

Mikroways will never request the passwords of the account nor will it have access to them,
since the authentication process will be carried out in an integral way between the user and
the identity provider (Google, GitLab or whatever) using well-known protocols.

### How we use the information

The account data provided by the client is used exclusively for the authentication and
authorization process to access services, and to provide the user with a fine grained
customized service as possible and according to their needs. Under no point of view will
it be used to send ads, or any other content that the user has not requested.

### Information confidentiality

Mikroways will not share the information with any company or organization under any circumstances
(except as required by judicial or legal order, or to protect property rights or other rights of Mikroways).

> Mikroways does not sell or rent user information.

### Change / Update personal information

The personal data provided by the user may be modified or updated at any time by their owners from the
[profile management portal](https://idp.mikroways.net/auth/realms/externos/account/).


### Personal information securityseek

The information provided by the user is secured by a password that only the user can access and
of which only he is aware. Mikroways will not attempt by any way to obtain this personal key.

The integrity of the information transmitted through the Internet, such as the password to access the services,
is protected by the security standards provided for the encryption of communications between computers.
In the integration with an identity provider, the authentication process is carried out entirely by identity provider,
and the security of the process is provided by the provider (Google, GitLab or whatever).

The user is the only responsable for keeping his password and account information secret.
To reduce risks, Mikroways recommends that the user always logout after the activity ends.

### Acceptance of the terms

This Confidentiality / Privacy statement is related to the terms and conditions of Mikroways,
thereby constituting a legal agreement between the user and Mikroways.

If the user uses Mikroways services, it means that they have read, understood and agreed to the terms set forth above.
If you do not agree with them, the user should not provide any personal information,
or use the service because they are not authorized to do so.
