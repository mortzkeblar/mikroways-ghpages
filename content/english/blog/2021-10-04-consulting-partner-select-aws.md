Starting today, Mikroways is select consulting partner of Amazon Web
Services. The path leading here demanded many requisites in terms of training
and certifications, deployed solutions, satisfactory testimonies received from
our customers, among others.

This recognition from AWS backs up all the work we have been doing and provides
us with access to tools and services that will help us continue to innovate and
improve, with the goal of maximizing the quality of our solutions.
